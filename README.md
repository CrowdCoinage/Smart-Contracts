# CrowdCoinage contracts

- ERC20.sol (Interface for ERC20 token standard)
- Relay.sol (Enables to update token as necessary)
- Token.sol (Code for the actual token)
- Ownable.sol (Contract for authorizations)
- Pausable.sol (Pausing contracts halt any non-owner interactions)
- SafeMathLib.sol (As a security precaution, We are extending the default math functions)
- Destructible.sol (Allows destrying the contracts)
